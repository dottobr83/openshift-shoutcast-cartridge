Shoutcast Distribution for Openshift Cloud Apps

Concept
-------

Streaming service with (not yet functional) scaling capabilities, simple one line installation:

Currently available distributions:
----------------------------------

* rhc app-create <app-name> http://shoutscale-rightoradio.rhcloud.com/manifest/master

* rhc app-create <app-name> https://github.com/theunknownartisthour/openshift-shoutcast-cartridge

Approach to scaling:
--------------------

Each gear or node hosts a distribution of shoutcast each with a modifiable configuration.
The first gear or node hosts shoutcast and acts as the primary relay point for other nodes.
The configuration is generated by environment variables which will always properly connect
Shoutcast.

Relaying:
---------

* RelayPort=80
* RelayServer=IP/URL

* portbase = ${OPENSHIFT_SCS_PORT}
* destip=${OPENSHIFT_SCS_IP}
* publicip=${OPENSHIFT_APP_DNS}

The gears are address based on the least amount of connections as determined by the standard
haproxy which can be added by using the --scaling option to the command lines above.

Current issues: 
---------------

* Creating a url endpoint to the first node which bypasses haproxy.
* Changing haproxy's configuration to avoid initial conflicts between haproxy's health check at the backend /

The issue is that this get requests the stream before there's a stream availalble, shoutcast responds with an http error
haproxy then closes outside connections from reaching the backend. Although not a problem if you just want to port forward into the app

* rhc port-forward <app-name>

Thank You's:
